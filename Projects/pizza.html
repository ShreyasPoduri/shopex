        <h2>Carrabbaâ€™s Italian Grill â€“ Pepperoni Pizza</h2>
        <p>This is a good pizza! Very simple, but very satisfying. Definitely something Iâ€™d recommend if youâ€™re in the
            mood for a good thin crust pizza.</p>

        <h2>Pepperoni â€“ Village Baker</h2>
        <p>Too much cheese, very basic overall flavor, itâ€™s okay.

            The fruit cup I had was better than the pizza ðŸ™ƒ</p>

        <h2>Motor City Pizza Co. â€“ Detroit-Style Deep Dish Pepperoni</h2>
        <p>I generally like a Detroit-style Deep Dish. Iâ€™ve never been big on the Chicago style, but the Detroit style with the thick crust can be really good when done well.

            This one is pretty good! The photo on the box looks horrible, but the actual pizza turned out really nice. Good amount of cheese and pepperoni, and while the crust is very basic itâ€™s not bad. Overall Iâ€™m fairly happy with this one and will probably be having it again.</p>
